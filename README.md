# public-scripts
A place for me to manage simple scripts which are publicly available.
This is my personal account using my work email address - I also have a personal account not related to my employers and an org for keeping work specific code - this is a sort of in-between. It will generally be used as my personal github while I remain at my current employment. If/when I move on I will clone all personal work which does not contain company owned information and will transfer ownership of the github content to another user (most likely Paul if he is still at the company).
