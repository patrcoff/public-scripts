# public-scripts
A place for me to manage simple scripts which are publicly available.
This is my 'personal' account, using my work email address - I also have a personal account not associated with my employment and an organisation for keeping work specific code - this is a sort of in-between account. It will generally be used as my personal github while I remain at my current employment. If/when I move on I will clone all personal work which does not contain company owned information and will transfer ownership of all work related content to another employee (most likely Paul if he is still at the company).
